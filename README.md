# üåü Suhail Chatbot Datasets  
This repository contains two datasets designed to explore and interact with Saudi culture. These datasets are tailored for educational purposes, cultural studies, and AI-based projects like training SuhailChatbot.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview  

Two datasets have been built for the Suhail chatbot. They were collected from **132 reliable sources**.  

### 1. General Dataset (`DataSet_general_u.csv`)  
This dataset is general and contains **166 rows and 4 columns** :  

- The **first column** represents the main categories, such as Architecture, Arts, Economy, and more.  
- The **second column** dives deeper to represent subcategories such as Religious Architecture, Heritage Villages, etc.  
- The **third column** provides pre-processed descriptions related to the different subcategories.  
- The **fourth column** contains the sources from where the data were collected, providing a reference if it is necessary to revisit the original information.  

The dataset is **text-based**, with **no missing values or null entries**. It is **well-structured**, meaning all fields are complete, ensuring a clean dataset for training purposes.  

### Dataset Characteristics:  

- **Total Samples:** 80 (equivalent to the number of rows).  
- **Memory Usage:** 18.5 KB (lightweight and easy to process).  
- **Structure:** Provides both general and specific information about Saudi culture.  

This dataset will be processed further in the form of questions with follow-up questions, which will be used to train the model of Suhail Chatbot.

### 2. Question-Based Dataset (`DataSet_Sohail-Qestions.csv`)  
This dataset enhances the functionality of SuhailChatbot by using information collected from reliable sources about Saudi cultural topics. It contains **16 columns** to facilitate detailed interactions, such as:  

- User queries about Saudi culture.  
- Initial responses, key entities, and follow-up questions to dive deeper into the topic.  
- Structured responses and additional insights to improve conversational quality.
